Approval Queue Plus for XenForo 2.1
===================================

This XenForo 2.1 addon adds extra info to the entries in the Approval Queue to help make approval decisions easier.

There is also an admin option to reverse the default sort order of the Approval Queue.

The following information is added to the queue display when approving users:

* Username
* Date joined
* Date of last activity
* Registration IP
* Location
* Time zone
* User Agent

Display of Email addresses, IP addresses and User Agents is controlled by moderator permissions.
